  <h1>Welcome to my <span class=fancy>About Me</span> page!</h1>

  <!-- ================Biography ====================-->
  <p>
    My name is Jennifer and I originally grew up in the San Fernando Valley in Southern California with my mom and her cats.  These days I live in West Seattle with my husband, my brother-in-law, two sugar gliders named Attila and Cicero, and a lot of house plants.
  </p>
  <!--=============== Education History ===========-->
  <h2>Education</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>After high school I moved north to attend college at <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz</a>.</li>  
    <li>While there I majored in Literature but spent most of my time with the Theater Department as a lighting designer and electrician.</li>
    <li>I also minored in Education.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- ===============Work Experience ============== -->
  <h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>While I was still a college student I worked as an electrician for the local summer <a href="https://www.santacruzshakespeare.org/">Shakespeare festival</a> that at the time staged productions on the UCSC campus.  It was my first paid position and I have a lot of fond memories from that period of life.</li>
   
    <li>After graduating, I spent several years working in early childhood education as a preschool teaching assistant - first in Northern California and then later in Seattle.  While I found the work very rewarding, I realized that it wasn't a career path I wanted to continue down. </li> 
    
    <li>The next few years were spent with an eco-conscious cleaning company where I worked initially as a house cleaner and then later as a scheduler and office manager.  </li>
    
    <li>I transitioned from this role to a direct sales position with a custom mensware company that had recently launched in the area.  However, the Seattle grunge aesthetic really isn't very conducive to high end mens fashion, and so while I picked up some excellent networking skills I realized that the job itself wasn't meant to be a long term fit.</li>
    
    <li>From there I moved on to a small tech startup in the renewable energy sector that was in need of an office manager and general assistance with operations (including construction of metering devices that took me back to my electrician days - a highlight of that job!).</li>
    
    <li>Last year I decided to take a break from the office setting and took a job at my local Trader Joe's as a crew member.  It was a great reset for me - allowing me to clear my head and reexamine what my priorities are while also introducing me to some amazing new friends.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- ====================Goals ===================-->
  <p>
    I'm not sure what the next step in my working life looks like, but I'm excited to see what doors may open once I have a firm understanding of the basics of coding.

    I've included links to the Goodreads page for each so that you can see what other people have to say about them as well - books are always more enjoyable when you can discuss them with friends.
